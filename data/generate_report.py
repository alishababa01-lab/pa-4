"""Generate the PA4 corpus: a fictional company annual report.

Produces two files in this folder from one source of truth:

The company (Meridian Motor Corporation) and all figures are FICTIONAL, so
there are no copyright or accuracy concerns. Figures are internally consistent:
segment and regional revenue both sum to the FY2023 net revenue of
¥16.91 trillion, and the marquee example query
    16.91 × 1.08^3 = 21.30 (trillion)
resolves exactly.
